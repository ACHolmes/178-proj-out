# CS178 Output Project: Passio Go Competitor!

## Usage/Running instructions

Install the required dependencies using `npm i`. You need a Google Maps API key, which you must place in a `.env` file, using `.env-example` as the template. This API key must allow for usage with the `JavaScript Maps API` - none of the others are currently required.

With this setup, you can run the app using `npm start`. This was created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), more info can be found there if you run into issues running this project.
